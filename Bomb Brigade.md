#INSTRUCTIONS for BOMB BRIGADE

**Premise**: Bomb Brigade is a high-stakes reflex-based game where two to five players take on the roles of a bomb squad in a tense electronic game reminiscent of Hot Potato or Russian Roulette. 

**Setup**: 2-5 players, 6 Blinks for a standard game. Designate one Blink to be the ‘bomb’ piece. This piece should be surrounded by other 5 pieces, leaving one side of the Blink empty. Double click on the center bomb piece to start the game. 

**Goal**: A player wins the game by being the last survivor of the bomb brigade, or when all the other players have been eliminated. 

**Gameplay**: During normal gameplay, the circular bomb piece will begin circling around the Blink. The bomb piece will be surrounded by shield pieces which serve as a defense against the bomb when it detonates. Players take turn trying to defuse the center bomb piece by single-tapping its center. Each time a single-tap occurs, one of two events can occur: 

The bomb defuses safely. In this case, the light indicator will briefly flash yellow before it resumes circling around the center Blink once more, only at a faster rate. 
The bomb can detonate. In this case, the light indicator will flash orange and the other lights will turn green. 

If a bomb defuses safely, the game simply proceeds to the next player’s turn. They will have a harder time defusing the bomb in their desired location due to the light spinning faster around the Blink. Each time a bomb is defused safely, it increases the chance that the next time the piece is clicked, that it will explode. 

If the bomb detonates, it deals damage to the corresponding shield piece it is next to when it explodes. This will reduce a shield’s overall health. Each shield can withstand three bomb explosions, and their healthiness is represented by their color. A green shield means it has not yet taken any hits, one hit will render it yellow, two hits will make it orange, and a red shield means it can only withstand one more explosion before being destroyed. When a shield is completely destroyed, it will start flashing all its lights in all colors in a haphazard manner. When this happens, this shield should be removed from the center piece and no longer be part of the game. A removed piece will emit a pleasant, rainbow swirl animation. 

If a bomb detonates in an area where there is no shield, the light indicator will turn white and the center bomb piece will start flashing red and orange. Any surviving shields will start flashing red and orange as well. When this occurs, the player who detonated the bomb is eliminated. 

In any case when a bomb detonates, simply double-click to to reset the bomb back its default speed to proceed to the next player’s turn. This will also reset the detonation chance back to normal. 

**Animations:**
